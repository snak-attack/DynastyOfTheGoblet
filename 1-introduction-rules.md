=========================
THE DYNASTY OF THE GOBLET
=========================

SECTION I. INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL RULES

Part 1 - Introduction

The Dynasty of the Goblet is the organization of the most powerful
and formidable creatures existing: the Vampires.

We join together to form a single Government, and in that, ensure our
success as the best Race, ally or trade with other Races, and plunder
the riches of the peoples too formidable to our cause. We shall become
the best there is, and with that, will have power over all the other
peoples of this world.

Part 2 - General Laws

To maintain governmental stability, we have certain Laws in place. To
join our Government, you must abide by these rules, specified here, and
in following Sections. Failure to do so will result in Ejection from the
Government.

1. Only Vampires may join under our glorious flag. To become a vampire,
commoners may either challenge our Lady, the Lilith Herself, or become
the Child of another Vampire (see Section IV: Children).

2. Members are taxed, treated, and listened to based on their Social Class.
There are various ways of moving up and down in this order, and it would be
desirable to be at the top.

3. Members must follow the orders of the Council members or the Government.

Part 3 - FAQ

Here are some questions that you may have about this Government.

Q: Who can join?
A: You didn't read anything, did you?

Q: Who is "I"?
A: snak_attack

Q: Is there a house for Vampires?
A: There will be a capital, but it will not be designed to house members
   for a long stay. However, there will be beds and places to relax.

Q: What are the specific rules regarding Factions?
A: You don't have to be in a particular Faction. You just have to follow all
   the rules, none of which have to do with which Faction you are in.

Q: What's the point?
A: Well, first off, it's a lot more interesting with politics. Also, the
   Government will provide for you, giving you supplies (see Section V: Taxes &
   Payments). There will also be wars and trading between different Races
   (as mentioned in Section I: Part 1).

Q: How do I become Royalty/in the Council?
A: I'll pick a few people to start off with - just make sure you are as powerful
   as you can get in the next few days. Then, there are other ways to become
   Royal or in the Council. You can become Royal by dueling the King, and get into
   the Council by election.

THE DYNASTY OF THE GOBLET
=========================

SECTION I. INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL RULES

The Dynasty of the Goblet is the organization of the most powerful
and formidable creatures existing: the Vampires.

We join together to form a single Government, and in that, ensure our
success as the best Race, ally or trade with other Races, and plunder
the riches of the peoples too formidable to our cause. We shall become
the best there is, and with that, will have power over all the other
peoples of this world.

To maintain governmental stability, we have certain Laws in place. To
join our Government, you must abide by these rules, specified here, and
in following Sections. Failure to do so will result in Ejection from the
Government.

1. Only Vampires may join under our glorious flag. To become a vampire,
commoners may either challenge our Lady, the Lilith Herself, or become
the Child of another Vampire (see Section IV: Children).

2. Citizens are taxed, treated, and listened to based on their Social Class.
There are various ways of moving up and down in this order, and it would be
desirable to be at the top.

3. Members must follow the orders of their superiors.

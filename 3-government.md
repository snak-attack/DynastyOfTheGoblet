THE DYNASTY OF THE GOBLET
=========================

III. POLITICAL SYSTEM

Part 1 - Introduction

The Dynasty's politics revolves around a King and his Council. Royalty who are
not otherwise in the government and the Wealthy have virtually no power.

Note: The King has the highest political position, but he does not have a lot of
power; he only acts as an amplified Council member.

The Council is composed of 3 to 9 members, and should be exclusive - it is
not easy to become a council member.

Part 2 - Voting

Council members, the King, the Wealty, or Royalty can request a vote on a proposition
(not a law), which cannot be turned down, unless it has already been asked and conditions
have not changed. Council members and the King will vote upon the proposition. The King's
opinion counts as one-third of the council's size (excluding the King), rounded down.

If more of the votes say "yes" than "no", then the new idea should be implemented.
If more of the votes say "no" than "yes", the new idea will not be implemented, and
that specific vote cannot happen again until circumstances change.
If the vote is a tie, the new idea will not be implemented, and that specific vote cannot
happen again until circumstances change.

Votes should be performed by having each voter put their opinion in a written & signed
book, then put the book into a chest. This way, it's impossible to pretend to be someone
else for their vote - you can see who wrote that vote by looking at the book's tooltip.

Votes take a time of 3 days to complete. During these 3 days, all voters will have a chance
to put their opinion in the chest. Then, the votes are drawn, and the vote's outcome is determined.

Part 3 - The Line of Succession

The position of Kingship is hereditary (see Section IV). However, it's possible to become
the King by dueling the King and other members fof the royal family.

The King-to-be must challenge the King to be in the royal family. Then, the challenger can
wait or duel other members of the royal family for a chance to be the King. If the King does
not perform the battle within 3 days of him or her being notified, the King automatically loses
the duel.

If the King loses, the challenger becomes Royalty, and is placed at the bottom of the line
for succession.

Royalty may duel other Royalty higher in the Line for Succession. If the challenger wins,
the defender moves down 1 succession rank, and the challenger moves up in the Line of
Succession.

If the King resigns, or 10 days has passed since the King came into power, the
King will lose kingship, and will still be in Royalty, but will be at the bottom
of the line for Succession. The next person in line for Succession will then be
the King.

This means that if you want to be the king, you'll have to defeat the King in order
to get into the Royal family. Then, you can either wait until it's your turn to be
the King, or challenge other members of the Royal family to be the first in the Line
of Succession.

Becoming another council member's child will result in a vote being cast on
whether to add the child as a Council member. The parent's vote is worth the
same amount as the King's vote, in this specific voting.

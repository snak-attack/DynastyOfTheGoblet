=========================
THE DYNASTY OF THE GOBLET
=========================

SECTION II. SOCIAL HIERARCHY

The need for a social organization arises in almost every form of Government.
For that reason, we have Laws relating to how important a Vampire is in
society.

The most respected of all is the King. In governmental voting, Kings'
opinions are worth one-third of the members in the Council, rounded down.
See Section III for more information.

Next come the Royalty. Royalty are all relatives (see Section IV) of each
other, and are to be treated with utmost respect. They do not, however,
necessarily hold a position in the Council. Also, Vampires do not need to
be a certain level to become Royalty.

Council members should be respected at all times. They are part of the
political group, and can cast votes in a vote. For more information, see
Section III. Council members must be Levels 8 to 10.

Wealthy vampires have been in the Dynasty for a long time. They may not
be royalty, but should be respected all the same. The wealthy have some
political power because they can vote for council member elections. To
be considered wealthy, the vampire must be Level 10.

Soldiers are vampires selected by the government to help out in wars and
such. Unless they have another, higher position (e.g. Royalty), they are
treated like normal, and do not have any political power. Soldiers are
levels 5 and up.

Citizens are standard vampires. Like soldiers, you will not have to go out
of your way to respect them. Citizens are levels 3 to 9. The longer they
have been in the Dynasty, and the higher level they are, the more you should
respect them.

The lowly are usually new Vampires, and are not particularly valued. Lowly
members should mostly be promoted to Soldiers, and then perhaps will become
Wealthy as well.

Commoners are the least respected. They are not even a part of the Dynasty;
instead, the term "commoner" refers to anyone who is not gifted with
Vampirism.
